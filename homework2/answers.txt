Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
GC-content: 0.45105133333333336
GC-content: 0.6468641125240355
GC-content: 0.3478523411663431
GC-content: 0.2631578947368421
GC-content: 0.4915185185185185

Problem 3:
a. By making GC_count = 0 a comment, we eliminated the outside variable. 
    Nothing is catching the local variable that is inside the for loop
    so we cant use it outside the for loop and can't update it either

b. The for loop is based on the string that was made by the file
    so taking away that string means that there isnt anything 
    to loop from. Nucleotides essentially doesnt exist so it
    crashes


Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content: 0.5689938518518518 

Problem 5:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 6:
Test small : all 3 the same
Sample 1, 2, 3, 4, 6: Sum is different than the other 2
gc 1, gc 2, moderate 1. moderate 2: Have total counts and length at 40000 
    but sum is different

Im assuming that the total count and length are counting the same
exact thing but the sum means there could be less of the amount. The sum will
always be at or less than the total. There could be other letter besides the four.

I would have to imagine exactly what the computer thinks I'm saying litterally.
To do that i have to find where the mistake was made and when. I can change it 
after

The denominator should be the total count or length, either is fine. They are
the greater number and always equal.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:
